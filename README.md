# Drawable Digit Recognition

Drawable Digit Recognition is based on a website application which is a form of application of the method theory recognition of handwritten digits using Supervised Learning The algorithm is the KNN Algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm) such as KNN with OpenCV Library and KNN with Scikit-Learn Library, Random Forest Classification Algorithm and SVM (Support Vector Machine Algorithm) Algorithm and with Deep Learning Algorithm, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with TensorFlow.
